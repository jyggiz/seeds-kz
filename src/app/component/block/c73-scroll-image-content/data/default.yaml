          of technology, nature, livability, sustainability and community are irrevocably linked.'

          community and the ideals NEOM will strive to realize.'

        - 'The NEOM brand mark consists of two elements: the NEOM future loop mark and the NEOM word
          mark.'
        - 'These elements have a fixed size and position relative to each other, which have been
          created as master artwork files. The brand mark should not be redrawn, reset or altered in
          any way. Additionally, never recreate or replace any of the patterns contained within the
          future loop mark. In certain situations, the NEOM future loop mark can appear without the
          NEOM word mark e.g. in social media applications.'
        - '*In text, the word NEOM is always written in capital letters.'

        size: medium
      descriptions:
        - 'NEOM, and the future loop mark, is built of five fundamental, interconnected principles –
          technology, nature, livability, sustainability and community.'
        - 'The five principles must always appear in the sequence shown here, never swapped around
          nor replaced with any other principle. Although the illustration for each principle is an
          obvious representation of that subject and commonly used, they have been adjusted so they
          can only be found in these particular colors and arrangement as part of the NEOM brand.
          They come together as a unique combination found nowhere else.'

          language, because the project represents a civilizational leap for humanity. So the name
          shouldn’t be from a specific civilization."'

        - 'Size limitations and production techniques require a version of the logo with larger
          patterns within the future loop mark, such as stitching the mark into fabric, or debossing
          into leather. For this the small use brand mark was created.'
