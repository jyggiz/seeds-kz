            '<p>Cream and white should be used predominantly or background colors. The light tones
            keep content fresh and easy to read. Cream should only be used for graphic elements and
            never for text. A deliberate and generous use of white space gives a premium and artful
            feel to communications and is an essential element of the NEOM brand. Black should be
            used sparingly within the system, and used primarily in rectangular frames and text.
            Gold is used as an accent color within the system. Gold is appropriate for use in
            infographics, icons, and other graphic elements meant to highlight important
            content.</p>'

            deliberately limited in order to complement the more vibrant colors of the future loop
            mark, ribbons and photography. This also works to preserve the purity and strength of
            the primary NEOM brand assets. Secondary colors should be used more sparingly than their
            primary counterparts when designing for the master brand – for example, to highlight
            information within technical documents and infographics.</p>'
