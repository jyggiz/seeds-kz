          '<p>As part of NEOM’s vision, environmental sustainability and wise resource use is at the
          forefront. NEOM aims to implement circular economic models across all fields, where all
          waste is utilized as valuable resources. The main “waste” from traditional wastewater
          treatment are biosolids or sludge. This is also the main resource, as a nutrient-rich
          dense organic material with the potential for nutrient and energy recovery. NEOM
          Wastewater aims to implement best practice biosolids management from the ground up with a
          strong focus on leveraging the regional need for land application and energy-neutral
          processes with Water Recycling and Recovery Plants (WRRPs).</p>'
