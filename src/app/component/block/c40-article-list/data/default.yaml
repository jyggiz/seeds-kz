    '<p><small>NEOM will meet all its water needs through desalination. It is also exploring using
    revolutionary, sustainable, and carbon-neutral “solar dome” technology. High value chemicals and
    minerals for use in industry will be extracted from the brine left behind by the desalination
    process and, in order to protect the marine ecosystem, we are committed to Zero Liquid Discharge
    (ZLD) to the ocean - a world-first at this scale.</small></p> <p><small>All wastewater will be
    recycled and harvested for cellulose, nutrients, grit and biogas. These will be used in
    landscaping, agriculture, energy, and construction. Seasonal storm water runoff will be retained
    and allowed to return to the land through development of wetlands and other retention
    methods.</small></p>'

      'NEOM will innovate desalination processes through revolutionary, sustainable and renewable
      technology. A vast facility integrated with brine processing, the Seawater Desalination Plant
      is at the core of this transformation. Based on new high recovery reverse osmosis membrane
      technology, it aims to supply the entire region for a 10 year period. These innovations will
      allow for a 60% recovery and will process up to 1M m3 of water a day.'

      'Potable water reservoirs, able to satisfy up to five days of demand, will be built across
      NEOM’s smart water network. Most of these reservoirs will be impressive concrete structures
      with a storage capacity of over 100,000 m3 to supply safe, high-quality drinking water
      on-demand.'

      'From coast to desert, all of NEOM’s regions will be supplied with water through a 600km
      network of carbon steel pipes, valves, equipment, utility, and pipeline culverts. Up to 20
      pumping stations will be commissioned and delivered by the end of 2024, and six major water
      reservoirs will be built over the next four years, aiming for a total storage capacity of six
      million m3.'
