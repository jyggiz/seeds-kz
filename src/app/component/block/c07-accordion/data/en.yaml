      '<p>THE LINE is a never-before-seen approach to urbanization – a 170km-long linear urban
      development of multiple, hyper-connected communities, with walkable neighborhoods integrated
      with public parks and the natural landscape. It is a model of urban design and livability in
      harmony with nature for the 21st century and beyond.</p><p>THE LINE will reshape the
      traditional concept of urban life, enabling NEOM to become an economic engine for the
      Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the region, and the world.</p><p>THE LINE will create 380,000 new
      jobs, spur economic diversification and contribute SAR 180bn to domestic GDP by
      2030.</p><ul><li>Powered by 100% renewable energy, the principles of environmental
      responsibility will be enshrined in business regulations to promote sustainable and
      regenerative development practices.</li><li>All essential daily needs will be within a
      five-minute walk.</li><li>Communities will be built around people, not cars, easily
      accessible and designed for convenience and walkability, creating vistas of beauty and
      tranquility. </li><li>THE LINE is supported by a physical and digital infrastructure layer
      seamlessly integrated beneath the surface and containing essential utilities and
      transportation services.</li><li>The infrastructure spine will include ultra-high-speed mass
      transit access to the communities along THE LINE.</li><li>Communities will live in harmony
      with nature, where open space, parks, gardens, the natural environment and sustainable food
      production are mixed seamlessly.</li><li>All businesses and communities on THE LINE are
      hyper-connected through a digital framework incorporating Artificial Intelligence and
      robotics that continuously learn and grow – over 90% of the data in NEOM will be analyzed to
      provide a predictive system with ever-improving services to residents and businesses.
      </li><li>The communities will be self-sufficient and reflect the personality of their
      residents, the region and the industries within them.</li></ul> <p><a href="#">REGISTER

    content:
      '<p>THE LINE is located in NEOM, linking the coast of the Red Sea with the mountains and
      upper valleys of the north-west of Saudi Arabia. The location is at the crossroads of the
      world, making it a natural choice for a global innovation hub. More than 40% of the global
      population will be able to reach NEOM’s breathtaking terrain in less than a four-hour
      flight, while 13% of the world’s trade already flows through the Red Sea.</p>'

      'Why is the design of THE LINE so unique? How will it make a difference in everyday life?'
    content:
      '<p>THE LINE’s future communities will be home to more than 1 million people from all over
      the world, creating a platform for innovation and prosperous businesses, addressing some of
      the world’s most pressing challenges.</p><p>THE LINE revitalizes urban living by
      reintroducing walkability as the cornerstone of urban design. It will create a sense of
      community by having nature, commerce, business and innovation at the heart. Powered by
      100%   renewable energy, with a digital framework incorporating AI and robotics, everything
      is built to serve human needs. </p><p>Walkability and livability are in the DNA of THE LINE.
      This pedestrian-first design approach defines THE LINE because of its ubiquitous
      relationship with nature, its comfort and flexibility placing everything you need within
      each community never more than a short walk away. Living, working and enjoying life without
      compulsory commuting is in the soul of the NEOM livability model.</p>'

    content:
      '<p>The project highlights NEOM’s never-before-seen approach to 21st century urban design.
      People and nature will reclaim the space once occupied by the car and congested roads
      through infrastructure that works in harmony with the environment, creating vistas of beauty
      and tranquility.</p><p>Communities will be powered by various types of renewable energy,
      allowing industry back into the heart of communities and creating an environment free from
      pollution. This pedestrian-first approach ensures the communities are built around people,
      not cars, easily accessible and designed for convenience and walkability. Essential services
      and amenities will be accessible within a five-minute walk.</p><p>Infrastructure and
      supporting services - including transportation, utilities, digital infrastructure, and
      logistics - will be seamlessly integrated in dedicated spaces running in an invisible layer
      along THE LINE. High-speed transportation will make long commutes a thing of the past,
      making life simple and stress-free.</p>'

      '<p>The majority of NEOM land will be preserved to enhance livability for residents and
      environmental protection. The design of THE LINE provides a seamless way of living in
      harmony with nature.</p><p>During development, strict environmental controls are in place to
      preserve NEOM’s natural environment and rich heritage. No construction activity is possible
      unless it has met stringent international sustainability criteria, which have been built
      around the standards expected for a Circular Carbon Economy.</p><p>While caring for the
      environment is a guiding principle, the plan allows NEOM to accomplish this without
      compromising NEOM’s ability to attract business and entrepreneurs to the region.</p>'
