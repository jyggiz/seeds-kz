  '<p>Cream and white should be used predominantly or background colors. The light tones keep
  content fresh and easy to read. Cream should only be used for graphic elements and never for text.
  A deliberate and generous use of white space gives a premium and artful feel to communications and
  is an essential element of the NEOM brand. Black should be used sparingly within the system, and
  used primarily in rectangular frames and text. Gold is used as an accent color within the system.
  Gold is appropriate for use in infographics, icons, and other graphic elements meant to highlight
  important content.</p>'
