      'Brown is a geometric sans-serif typeface designed by Aurèle Sack and released through Lineto.
      One cool thing about Brown is that it includes several stylistic variants—a reclining version
      that slopes backwards and an alternate version that includes additional unique characters.
      Brown is available in four weights—thin, light, regular and bold—each with matching italics.'

      '29LT Bukra is a contemporary geometric typeface drawn with sleek mono-linear structure that
      unveils a futuristic and clean sensation. Its modern simplistic arrangement gives the typeface
      suitability for corporate and bold content text. It is mainly a display type while the light
      and book weights can be used for short body text. The Arabic letterforms were designed based
      on the Kufic structure whereas the Latin character set was designed based on the Sans Serif
      structures that lends a font a unique feel and a innovative structure.'

      '29LT Zarid Sans is direct and fresh. It is a combination of an Arabic Neo Naskh accompanied
      with a unique Sans Latin counterpart. It respects and inspires from the calligraphic writing
      systems while drawn with modern features and graphical qualities. The equilibrium between the
      main body structure of the letters and their corresponding ascenders and descenders is
      carefully studied to give the typeface a contemporary composition without affecting legibly.
      It is modern-day low contrast typeface with strong charactersitics that distinguish it from
      other sans serif fonts.'

    'The typographic scale has been used for centuries as a means of creating balanced and
    harmonious font sizing. It is the bedrock of modern typography. A modular scale increases
    readability and legibility. This makes your content easier to understand. A modular scale is
    based off proportionate relationships. One of the most common proportions used when creating a
    typographic scale, 3:4 (perfect fourth).'
