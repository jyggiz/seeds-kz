          'Tayeb Al-Ism is one of the magical natural wonders of Saudi Arabia that takes visitors by
          surprise. This incredible natural feature of Tabuk Province is located on the Gulf of
          Aqaba, just 15 kilometers north of the coastal town of Maqna. When approaching by the road
          that runs along the turquoise waters and white beaches of the Gulf of Aqaba, what strikes
          people first is the imposing shape of the 600-meter-high granite massif of the Tayeb
