          'Going through an airport is rarely a pleasure due to the rigid global aviation industry,
          but new disruptive solutions can move the dialon the customer experience and at the same
          time boost economic growth – writes NEOM Airports CEO John Selden.'

          'Most passengers arrive at an airport with one thing on their mind: How quickly can I get
          out of here? For the sake of enhanced customer experience and increased capacity, it makes
          sense for airports to be much more about freedom of movement and much less about keeping
          people captive, in order to overcharge them for bottled water and cold sandwiches. <br />
          In fact, the provocative question should be asked as to whether airports should even be
          for-profit at all. Perhaps they might, instead, be looked at as a public good. Simply
          there to generate benefits for citizens, places and economies.'

          'Especially when you consider that today airports are struggling in the aftermath of
          COVID. The pandemic meant they temporarily lost their passenger base and workforce. I used
          to run Atlanta, the busiest airport in the world, and we went from 2,400 flights a day –
          with 320,000 passengers – to almost nothing overnight when the virus hit. As customer
          demand has quickly bounced back after the restrictions were lifted, the capacity to scale
          back up again has been lost due to employee shortages. It takes time to vet, hire and
          train new staff. Expect worse to come. By 2050, forecasters are predicting that the number
          of passengers will grow by a factor of 2.5 on the pre-COVID levels of 2019. If we carry on
          regardless, it will <strong>mean</strong> chaos for airlines, airports and worse still
          customers. Ticket prices will rise through the roof. Pollution levels will escalate. Noise
          pollution will blight lives. And urban sprawl will be unstoppable. Bigger airports,
          expanded budgets and limitless runways are not the answer. For example, London Heathrow
          Airport – like many of the global aviation hubs – is already completely saturated and
          after 20 years of trying they still do not have approval for a third runway. And even if
          you do build bigger terminals, passengers don’t want to travel 45 minutes to get to their
          gate. The new airport in Istanbul will serve 350 destinations from 10 runways. This
          untrammeled expansion is simply not the way to go. Smart airports, progressive design and
          advanced technologies with a human touch are the areas where our energy must be channeled.'

          'Artificial intelligence, meanwhile, can guide passengers around the airport in the same
          way that Google Maps gets people to their destinations. It should be that easy to find
          somewhere to change your currency, buy a coffee or find an Uber by simply looking at an
          app on your phone. For that matter, while you’re in the air on a plane, there is no reason
          free dependable 6G shouldn’t be the norm. If I’m a regular traveler, why do I have to
          choose from 50 movies I’ve already seen? Why can’t I have 200 movies I may not have
          watched? Why can’t I use the time to catch up on emails or watch Netflix? Although not all
          solutions require expensive tech. Imagine if we board passengers by window, middle and
          then aisle seats – rather than by seat number or zone. That sort of simplification saves
          so much time, pain and effort. We want to see all these next-gen features and more besides
          in our NEOM airports. Luckily, we have a blank sheet of paper, so if anyone can do it we
          can. This will extend to our NEOM airline too, meaning we can create continuity of service
          from destination-to-destination – including time on the plane. It will be completely
          integrated and seamless because both the airline and the airport will be serving the same
          vision, same owner and same passenger. Innovations in the air might even include
          horizontal seats in all classes and perhaps a better way to manage hand luggage that
          doesn’t require you to store a bag above your head.'

          airport as quickly as is humanly possible. Although, to unlock more capacity, we will
          probably want them to.'
