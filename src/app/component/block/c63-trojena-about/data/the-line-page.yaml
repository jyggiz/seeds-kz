          'However, the true wonder is not this incredible city – but what it delivers. A city with
          no cars means no traffic jams, which means more time to spend with loved ones. A city with
          a diverse collection of open spaces suspended on multiple levels means no one is ever more
          than a two-minute walk from nature.'

          'A city that creates no pollution and uses only 100% renewable energy can provide nothing
          but clean air for all. And a city built in NEOM, the most temperate part of Saudi Arabia –
          coupled with the fact that the city utilises advanced ventilation technology – means THE
          LINE can guarantee ideal weather 24/7, 365 days a year. The pioneering solutions to the
          challenges of urbanisation that we are are developing on THE LINE will be able to help
          change the future not just for its citizens, but for everyone. That’s why we believe we
          are creating new wonders for the whole world.'
