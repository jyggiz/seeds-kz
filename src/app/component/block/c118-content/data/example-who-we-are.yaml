                technology. High value chemicals and minerals for use in industry will be extracted
                from the brine left behind by the desalination process and, in order to protect the
                marine ecosystem, we are committed to Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) to the ocean - a
                world-first.</small></p> <p><small>All waste water will be recycled and harvested
                for cellulose, nutrients, grit and biogas. These will be used in landscaping,
                agriculture, energy and construction. Seasonal storm water runoff will be retained
                and allowed to return to the land through development of wetlands and other
                retention methods.</small></p>'
