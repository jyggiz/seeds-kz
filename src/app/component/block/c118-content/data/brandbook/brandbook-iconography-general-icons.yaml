                <p>For all other iconography we use a flat version of the ribbon, without shadows.
                This ensures the economic sector icons are seen to have a more important role within
                NEOM. They are uniform in line width, used at small to medium sizes and rendered in
                any of the primary colors. The twist in the ribbon ensures they stand out as unique
                to NEOM.</p>
