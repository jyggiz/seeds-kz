                shape. NEOMâ€™s principles of future facing, multifaceted, graphic and bold in color
                underpin all commissioned photography, and as much as it must look beautiful and
                aspirational it must also feel as real as possible.<br><br>The choice of
                photographer is critical to any shoot and must be chosen based on experience
                capturing the NEOM style.</p>'
