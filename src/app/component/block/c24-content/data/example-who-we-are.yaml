          '<p><small>NEOM will meet all its water needs through desalination. It is also exploring
          using revolutionary, sustainable, and carbon-neutral “solar dome” technology. High value
          chemicals and minerals for use in industry will be extracted from the brine left behind by
          the desalination process and, in order to protect the marine ecosystem, we are committed
          to Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) to the ocean - a world-first.</small></p> <p><small>All
          waste water will be recycled and harvested for cellulose, nutrients, grit and biogas.
          These will be used in landscaping, agriculture, energy and construction. Seasonal storm
          water runoff will be retained and allowed to return to the land through development of
          wetlands and other retention methods.</small></p>'
