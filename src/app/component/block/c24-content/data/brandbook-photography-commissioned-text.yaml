          '<p>Portraiture and group shots are more subtle because of their personal nature. NEOM is
          at the start of its journey but it needs to feel like a real place is taking shape. NEOMâ€™s
          principles of future facing, multifaceted, graphic and bold in color underpin all
          commissioned photography, and as much as it must look beautiful and aspirational it must
          also feel as real as possible.<br><br>The choice of photographer is critical to any shoot
          and must be chosen based on experience capturing the NEOM style.</p>'
