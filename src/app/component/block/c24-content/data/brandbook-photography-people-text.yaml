          saturation are controlled to feel honest and sympathetic to the subject. Expressions are
          natural, relaxed and confidently looking direct to camera. The photographers Jody Rogac or
          Abdullah Alshehri would be a good choice for this style.<br><br>NEOM black and white
          portraits are shot with the same expectations but we allow for more contrast.</p>'
