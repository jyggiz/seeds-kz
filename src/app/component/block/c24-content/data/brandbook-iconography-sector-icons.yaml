          <p>Our economic sector icons represent a broad range of different subjects and should only
          be used when communicating specifically about these subjects. They are only used in the
          full color versions shown here. When talking about a specific economic sector, the icon
          can be a hero element. When talking about all of the economic sectors, the sector icons
          must be arranged and sized in a way that shows them as equal. Do not alter or create
          alternate versions of the economic sector icons. Use the ones provided.</p>
