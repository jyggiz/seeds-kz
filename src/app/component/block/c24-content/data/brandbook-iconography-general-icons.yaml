          <p>For all other iconography we use a flat version of the ribbon, without shadows. This
          ensures the economic sector icons are seen to have a more important role within NEOM. They
          are uniform in line width, used at small to medium sizes and rendered in any of the
          primary colors. The twist in the ribbon ensures they stand out as unique to NEOM.</p>
