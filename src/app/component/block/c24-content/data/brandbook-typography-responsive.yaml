          <p>Responsive web design is a methodology to create websites that scales and adapts
          depending up the size of the screen and capabilities of the device on which the website is
          being viewed.</p> <p>For example, content and images scale to best fit the screen,
          navigation pattern changes according to the capabilities of the device. Therefore it is
          crucial for typography to adopt the responsive nature of the design to make the content
          legible and appealing on all devices.</p>
