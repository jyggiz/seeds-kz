  - question:
      Could you map out where water sits in the grand vision for NEOM and how integral it is to the
      project’s success?
    answer:
      That is like asking which United Nations Sustainable Development Goal is water not involved
      with? Out of all 17 goals, water is involved in virtually every one except for low energy. But
      even then, we must have low water costs to have low energy. <br><br> At NEOM, water interacts
      with every single sector. You cannot have a hotel without having water or without wastewater
      getting taken away. And you cannot even mix cement without water. What is really important,
      from a water perspective, is to make sure that it is low cost and available in the beginning
      stages of construction. <br><br> And in the final stages, also making sure it is low cost,
      available and meeting the sustainable development goals – so that is pressurized, drinkable
      quality water going to every premises. And bringing processed wastewater and recycling back
      from every premises as well. Achieving low cost, availability and water efficiency brings out
      a circular economy. By reusing water as much as possible, you limit the amount that you have
      to desalinate.
  - question: What are the world firsts your team is working on?
    answer:
      It will be the first time that desalination is done fully through renewable energy. It will be
      the first time that desalination is done without any effluent going back to the sea, as in
      zero liquid discharge. It will be the first time that full brine processing is being
      performed. <br><br> We will not only recycle 100% of the water, but we will also do a
      biosolids treatment. That will mean zero liquid discharge and zero solid discharge because we
      will be converting the solids from waste treatment plants to fertilize them. We will be
      converting the biomes and generating energy from the biomes to help us become self-sustainable
      in energy. The process from beginning to end is going to be the first time in the world that
      you have such an efficient process that looks at water in such an effective manner with a full
      circular economy. <br><br> It will also be the first time in the world that mineralized water
      ­– water that has magnesium fluoride with the same quality as spring water ­– will be
      delivered to every premises and every household, in order to eliminate the need for all
      bottled water in NEOM. <br><br> Our smart network will also incorporate water flow, water
      volume, temperature, water quality and pressure management zones. Of course, there have been
      some tests around the world previously, but no one has ever implemented it on a global scale
      like this.
  - question:
      NEOM is aiming for Industry 4.0 – would you be able to map out what that means and how it is
      possible?
    answer:
      Net zero means that we do not put any water back into the sea from desalination, so zero
      liquid discharge. Net zero means that we do not put any CO2 into the environment because we
      are running fully on renewable energy; whether that is pumping water, treating water,
      desalination or dealing with wastewater. All of that is on net zero energy. <br><br> We are
      looking to put zero CO2 into the atmosphere, we want to utilize all renewable energy. Net zero
      means we treat all the wastewater, so none of it goes back into the environment. We have zero
      solid disposal, utilizing the solids to make products. We also will be making products out of
      seawater. <br><br> If you can take the water out of the sea and solidify that CO2, you are
      benefiting the environment. Net zero also means zero runoff. So the biggest problems that you
      have around the world now in Singapore, Hong Kong, Jeddah, London, Paris and New York is that
      when it rains, all the stormwater runoff takes with it all the oil from the cars on the road –
      and it takes all the pesticides from the trees and from the gardens. <br><br> The reason why
      the Great Barrier Reef is dying today is because they have a huge amount of sugar cane fields
      on the East Coast of Australia and they put pesticides on them. When it rains, those
      pesticides run into the rivers and into the sea – meaning those pesticides kill off the Great
      Barrier Reef. They have only started figuring that out in the last 10 years or so. Net zero
      runoff also means making sure that does not go into the sea and impact our environment.
  - question:
      How is this all possible at NEOM? Is it purely about a coming together of super advanced
      technology and the greatest minds on the planet?
    answer:
      I have been in industry for a long time and the frustration with tech companies is that people
      just do not implement the technology. That is due to many reasons, mostly for political
      funding reasons in Africa, India or some parts of Asia – for example. <br><br> When there is
      no competition, what is your incentive to improve your water utility? We have funding here in
      NEOM, so this issue has gone away. The other benefit is that we do not have political
      interference because there are no politicians today, and we do not have any regulators. We
      form our own regulations. <br><br> In most of the cities around the world, water
      infrastructure is failing or old. And because it's so old, 30 to 60% of water is lost. Our
      system is going to be new, and we are going to have a smart network in place. That way, we
      will have less than 3% water losses. <br><br> A lot of water utilities have limitations when
      it comes to the number of staff or their experience, and so they do not have the capabilities
      to implement innovation and, therefore, they are inherently conservative. We will structure
      ourselves very differently in that we will not have a team of 3,000 people, we will have a
      team of 200 people. Although, we will outsource everything. <br><br> For example, for field
      services, we will outsource to people that know how to utilize their own technology. We will
      use all of the data inside a cognitive city, with edge computing to act on leakages at houses
      – for instance. <br><br> We are going to take all of the technology that exists. And that tech
      that does not yet exist, we will develop ourselves. We can test out these technologies,
      validate them and then commercialize them. <br><br> Some cultures would say that reutilizing
      water from a wastewater treatment plant is dirty. So sure, we will not be drinking the water
      that comes out of these facilities. We will be using it for landscaping, but essentially the
      quality of the water that comes out of there is drinkable quality. This is already happening
      in the world, so we are not inventing anything new there. However, we are putting a lot of
      technologies together that most people do not do.
