  'As a new way of working and living, NIC was such a compelling option for my company partners and
  I. The accessibility, connectivity and sustainability just show what can be done when a city is
  built from scratch â€“ with progressive goals and a recognition that the legacy systems of the past
  are no longer fit for purpose.'
