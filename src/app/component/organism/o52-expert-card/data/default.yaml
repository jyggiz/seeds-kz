question:
  Could you map out where water sits in the grand vision for NEOM and how integral it is to the
  projectâ€™s success?
answer:
  That is like asking which United Nations Sustainable Development Goal is water not involved with?
  Out of all 17 goals, water is involved in virtually every one except for low energy. But even
  then, we must have low water costs to have low energy.
