  'Brine processing is at the heart of NEOM’s circular water economy, transforming the by-product of
  seawater desalination into high value-chemicals, minerals and metals for industrial and
  agricultural use. We will build and operate a cutting-edge brine harvesting and processing plant
  integrated with the desalination facility. At the same time, we’ll create a research and
  development hub that will explore new technologies and products for the industry.'
